# Kimberley Ni's First CS193 Homework

## Favorite Things About CS 193:

- It's very cool that we have students from the USB teaching us!
  - It makes it more welcoming than some other daunting classes.
- I get to see other CS students in my year.
- CS 193 will teach me how to use GitHub and LaTeX, which I will definitely find useful later on.
